An application that runs a console.

It uses Swing programming to make a GUI. At the moment, there is no scroll bar, so you have to use the "clear" command in order to clear   the screen.

To enter a command, simply type it in and press enter. It will run it, and if there is an output, it will print it out.

This package also includes a .jar file that runs all of these classes.
